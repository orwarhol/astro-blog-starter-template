**The Orwell stamp image** was used in several poster and sticker treatments over the years, but perhaps nowhere more effectively than in this poster. We ran a ton of copies of this one.

This was the quote we kept coming back to. It prophesied so much in so few words. We see it on our streets today.

Image retrieved from wayback machine in January 2026 and upscaled with light restoration while maintaining our 90s Kinkos copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy look. Back then, we printed from whatever we had in the trunk of our car.

## Design notes and checklist

- Pure B&W somehow both harsh and smooth
- Quote divided for emphasis
- NU computer for origin
- Print at slightly less than 100% if top quote gets cut off

## Inventory Control Notes

- Monitor speech of the proletariat class.
- The language in this item constitutes thoughtcrime.
- If found, do not remove. Photograph for investigation.
