This poster concept riffs on classic dystopian iconography: a stark, watchful eye dominates the composition while bold, condensed type delivers the headline. The layout intentionally borrows the visual grammar of mid‑century propaganda—high contrast, limited palette, and economical messaging—to create a feeling of institutional address that is both familiar and unsettling.

The piece was conceived in the late 1990s as a commentary on emerging surveillance technologies and the cultural shift toward always‑on monitoring. Although the design nods to historical propaganda, its aim is critical rather than celebratory: to make viewers aware of how easily authoritative visual language can normalize invasive systems. Early iterations explored different halftone scales and type pairings to balance menace with legibility.

In terms of production, the poster was printed as a small run on 11x17 stock. Anecdotally, small registration shifts in the print proofs—slightly misaligned inks and textured paper grain—became desirable artifacts that reinforced the analog, human side of the message. Those imperfections contrasted the poster's theme of mechanical surveillance, giving it a tactile counterpoint to the concept.
